When helping with Unity tasks:
1. Always read relevant C# scripts before suggesting changes
2. Follow the project patterns in CLAUDE.md
3. Use the Explore agent to find related code
4. Check both Sorolla Core (framework) and _Game (game-specific) folders
5. Preserve existing architecture (Service Locator, async/await patterns)
